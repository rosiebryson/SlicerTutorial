#HOW TO: Collect Orbital Circumference in 3D Slicer

## We'll begin in the **Segment Editor module**. Start by creating a segmentation of the skull.

## Next, rotate your segmentation so that the **LEFT** orbit is oriented towards you.

## Navigate to the **Markups Module**

## Place points around the orbital apertuer following the natural contour of the margin.

## Now rotate your segmentation and adjust the points as necessary to best fit the anatomy or the orbital margin. Make sure to look at it from all angles.

## Now that you've finished collecting your Closed Curve, click on the ** Measurements** dropdown menu on the left hand side of the screen:

## And select the measurement you'd like to collect: "Length" of this closed curve will give you Circumference, "Area" will give you the Orbital Aperture area.
